  <p>Welcome, managers, to sacred and cursed ground.</p>
  <p>You have not arrived here by accident. You are here because of pain.</p>
  <p>Because of hope that turned to ash. Because of "this is the year" that somehow became week 15, WR38, and a first round exit.</p>
  <p>This league was forged in the fires of broken projections, Sunday afternoon despair, and the soft glow of RedZone mocking you while your so-called "cornerstone asset" put up 4.6 points on 9 targets.</p>
  <p>DJ Moore Sucks is not just a league name, it is a statement. A coping mechanism. A memorial to dynasty wounds that never heal.</p>
  <p>Here we remember the elite prospect tha was about to ascend, the buy-low candidate that became a hold forever, the trade you defended in the group chat...and still think about at night.</p>
  <p>In this league, grudges are permanent. Receipts are eternal. You may win championships but you will never forget who hurt you along the way.</p>
  <p>Draft with confidence, trade with bitterness, start your lineup with reckless optimism.</p>
  <p>And when a player betrays you - when a "safe floor WR2" posts a single digit-dud in the playoffs - just know:.</p>
  <p>They may someday earn a league name of their own</p>
  <p>Welcome to DJ Moore Sucks</p>
